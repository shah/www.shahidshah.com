Like Tim, I’m a health IT blogger and I read HIStalk because the writing is prescient, accurate, useful, and relevant. Getting healthcare technology content right and keeping it readable is really tough but somehow Tim makes it look so easy. As a fellow blogger I’ve often read articles on HIStalk which makes me say ‘gosh, I wish I wrote that!’ I’ve read Tim and his publications from day 1, will continue to read them on my own, and will continue to recommend them highly to everyone else who wants intelligible advice on healthcare technology.
