I met Shahid at the Dell Think Tank on Healthcare earlier this year. He was very knowledgeable about the economics behind HITECH and the widespread adoption of EMR technology, and how these fit within the regulatory framework. He obviously has a great deal of experience in the industry, and provides thought leadership. I look forward to working with Shahid in future projects and/or initiatives.
