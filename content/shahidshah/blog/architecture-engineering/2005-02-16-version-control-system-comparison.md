I&#8217;ve been a longtime user of CVS and am still generally happy with it. However, to keep up to date on the latest technologies I&#8217;ve been considering moving to something more modern. While studying up on the subject of revision control I ran across this [Version Control System Comparison][1] article. Seems pretty thorough and quite useful.
