Microsoft has a couple of good articles on Multi-Tenant data architecture, where software as a service [SaaS] applications can all share a single database for multiple customers (&#8220;tenants&#8221;). The multi-tenant architecture and design is nothing new but the Microsoft guys have done a good job describing it.

[Read the article here][1].
