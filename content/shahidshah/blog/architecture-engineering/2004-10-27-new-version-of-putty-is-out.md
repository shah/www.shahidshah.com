If you&#8217;re a heavy user of PuTTY, like I am, you&#8217;ll want to grab the [latest release][1] which fixes a major security hole. In case you don&#8217;t already know, PuTTY is a free Windows SSH and Telnet client (which is actually now available for UNIX as well). It also serves as an XTerm emulator including X11 forwarding (plus general packet forwarding if required).
