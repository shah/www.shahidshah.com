<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/09/how-to-demo-your-startup/" target="_blank">This is an article</a> I wish I wrote. It&#8217;s about how to demonstrate your startup or business idea to a stranger on the phone or in an audience. Since people pitch me their products (which I enjoy, of course), I see lots of demos every month. At then end of each demo I almost always give advice on how the demo could have gone better and the folks at TechCrunch have captured it quite nicely. Check it out and learn from both <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/09/how-to-demo-your-startup/" target="_blank">Part I</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/01/how-to-demo-your-startup-part-two/" target="_blank">Part II</a>.
