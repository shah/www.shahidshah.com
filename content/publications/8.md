description: The 2009 stimulus bill's HITECH Act offers money to physicians, hospitals, and multi-hospital systems if they become "meaningful users" of certified electronic health records (EHR) systems. In order to meet meaningful use rules for EHR systems, you will need to create your own architecture to support lightweight applications. This article describes how to add meaningful use and other business requirements as lightweight ancillary tools connected to your EHR system without adding risk to your existing environment.
