content_title: "C++: Move Semantics"
content_description: "Dive deeper into C++ with move semantics, a key component of C++ resource management. Move semantics allow you to optimize the transfer of data and reallocate memory without extra copy operations. In this course, Bill Weinman helps you understand rvalues (temporary values that are the key to move semantics); create move constructors and operations; and use the copy-and-swap idiom to 'swap in' new data while destroying the old."
