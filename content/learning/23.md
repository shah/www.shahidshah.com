content_title: Learning Bash Scripting
content_description: Bash, or the Bourne Again Shell, is a widely popular command-line interpreter for administration and programming tasks. It's also the default option on Mac OS X and Linux. But Bash is different than most scripting languages. That's why Scott Simpson spends some time in this course running you through the syntaxâ€”introducing variables, numbers, and control structuresâ€”so you can start writing scripts right away. He shows you how to wrap up multiline operations in one file, implement flow control, and interact with users to get input. Plus, he offers challenges along the way that allow you to put what you've learned to the test.
