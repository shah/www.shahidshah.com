content_title: "Vocal Production Techniques: Editing and Mixing in Pro Tools"
content_description: "Vocals are one of the most critical pieces of any song. No other instrument has as much power or influence. But almost every vocal track can benefit from some post-production. _Vocal Production Techniques_ introduces editing and mixing techniques for the most popular DAWs. This course focuses on Pro Tools.   
Audio engineer Scott Hirsch starts with comping the vocalsâ€ combining the best performances into one final vocal master take. He explains how to edit out breaths and other noises and fabricate a doubling effect for additional texture and vibe, and then brings in some plugins into the mixâ€ Antares Auto-Tune, Melodyne, and iZotopeâ€to tune vocals and create more interesting soundscapes. In the 'Mixing' chapter, Scott enhances the sound of the vocals with EQ, compression, reverb, delay, and automation, adding life and motion to the song. The final track demonstrates everything you can do to maximize the effectiveness of vocals with Pro Tools."
