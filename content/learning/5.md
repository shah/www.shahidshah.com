content_title: Creating a Keynote Presentation
content_description: The keynote is a special speech. As the cornerstone of an event, these talks tend to be longer than traditional speeches, more entertaining than strictly educational, and delivered to large audiences. If you've been asked to deliver a keynote, then this course can help by showing you how to plot out and deliver a lively, impactful presentation that drives your message home. Join Todd Dewett as he spells out how to structure your keynote, craft a compelling story, use emotions to enhance your overall message, and prepare to deliver on the day of the event.
